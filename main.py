def tic_tac_toe(GRID_SIZE=3):

    '''
    Commences and runs a game of tic-tac-toe on a GRID_SIZE x GRID_SIZE playing board.
    GRID_SIZE must be an int such that 3 <= GRID_SIZE <= 26.

    Columns are enterd as letters of the alphabet while rows are numberd from one.
    When entering a coordinate to place a stone, columns must be enterd first and rows second.
    Examples of valid input on a 3x3 board would be the following: a1, b1, a2, c3.
    Examples of invalid input on a 3x3 board would be the following: a4, d1, B2, c 3, 2b, Hello world!

    At the start, a player is randomly selected to make the first move.
    The first player to fill a row, a column or a diagonal with their stones wins.
    If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
